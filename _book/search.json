    "text": "Preface\nI have been teaching a Bachelor’s Project (BAP) at Leiden University for several years now. I have seen great theses, poor theses, and everything in between as both a supervisor and as a second reader on theses in other courses. This book is a collection of materials that I have been developing for the past several years aimed at giving you additional guidance for developing a good (perhaps even great) thesis.\nThere are three main sections to this book:\n\nWriting the Thesis: This part slightly puts the cart before the horse by considering the written product of the thesis - what should be in it, how to structure it, and how to communicate effectively. It also provides links to some other resources that I think can help you in this process (see the starting preface/part of each section for additional resources).\nDoing Research: This part focuses on the process of doing research. In particular, it provides some guidance on how to find relevant research to review for your project and how to think about finding relevant data to analyze (presuming you are not collecting your own).\nPractical Issues in Data Analysis: This section focuses on providing some advice on how to analyze and present data in an effective manner. It is not a full primer on statistical analyses (you should consult your Statistics I/II notes and the resources provided there for that), but seeks to bridge the gap between the abstract and the practical.\n\nWhat I write naturally reflects my own opinions and tastes. That does not make them “correct”, of course, although this information may still be of value even if it is purely idiosyncratic to me as a reader given that I’m one of the people grading your thesis! In addition, this document, by its very nature, is focused on general advice; your specific project may require deviations or alterations to what I suggest here.\nI will highlight some other resources for helping you along the way in subsequent sections as I note above. One resource that I want to highlight here is a Substack written by two political scientists–Paul Musgrave and Nicholas Davis–called “Thesis Statement” (weblink). These authors have written a host of short, but very insightful, posts on how to approach nearly every part of writing one’s senior thesis. I would strongly recommend reading through what they have written as well.",

You can find links to some of the resources I draw upon below. I recommend giving them a quick read through as well since they are pretty short, but note that some of these documents are pitched at particular institutions or particular types of assignments, so not every point in them will be relevant.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "In general, a BAP thesis can be divided into the following portions:\n\n\nIntroduction\nReview of Literature and Argument\nResearch Design\nAnalyses/Results\nConclusion\nAppendix/Appendices\n\nI discuss each portion of the thesis in the chapters to come. But, first, a few beginning thoughts.\nFirst, do not take the above as meaning that you need to have exactly this number of sections in your thesis. It may, and often does, make sense to divide some of these portions into separate sections or subsections. The Review of Literature and Argument portion of the thesis, for instance, is often best divided into two or more sections to avoid overwhelming the reader with too much information all at once and to signal changes in topic within the thesis. It is not a bad idea, meanwhile, to divide the Research Design section into sub-sections as I’ll discuss later on.\nRegardless of these points, there should be clear section headers to delineate where each portion of the thesis begins and where the next one ends with the exception of the Introduction which does not require a section header. I prefer, and recommend, the APA style for section headers shown here with main sections centered and bolded and then sub-section headers left-aligned and bolded. For instance:\n\nA second consideration concerns length The thesis, as a whole, should be between 7,000-8,000 words (excluding the title page and references). A natural question might then be: how long should each portion be? There is no single correct answer to this question. What follows, then, are highly general recommendations that will need to be revised in relation to your particular research question and project. I would not get too attached to the specific numbers here - they were not created via any type of scientific process beyond me trying to eyeball my own writing, and past theses, and throwing out some plausible sounding ranges. However, the ranges may give some sense of the relative importance of each section.\n\nIntroduction: ~500-1000 words\nLiterature Review and theory: ~1500-2500 words\nResearch Design: ~700-1500 words\nAnalyses/Results: ~700-1500 words\nConclusion: ~600-1500 words\n\nFinally, I have a sixth item above: Appendix or Appendices. There are two types of appendix that it makes sense to include: (1) one that gives some additional details on how control variables are measured and operationalized in your model; (2) one that goes into detail about your assumption checks. I’ll discuss these in sections to come. An important point: appendices do not count toward the word count of the thesis.",

    "title": "2  The Introduction",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The introduction is a mini-preview of the paper to come. The reader should come away from this section understanding what the topic of the paper is, what the specific question you are investigating is, why these things are interesting/relevant (the stakes of the research), and have a sense of what your answer to the question is.\nHow should you go about writing this section and accomplishing these goals? Here is an outline of a paper I recently wrote that exemplifies one way of approaching these tasks.1 The bit after the colon (e.g., “Paragraph 1: blah blah blah”) indicates the general goal of the paragraph, while the bit after “Example:” indicates the specific point I was trying to make in that paragraph in this particular paper. This is an example of how to think about using an outline to help you structure your thinking and make it easier to write (see Chapter 3).\n1 Although, given the nature of time, “recently” here is receding further and further into the past.\nParagraph 1: Here is an important subject to consider\n\nExample: People follow party cues with potentially problematic normative implications for democracy.\n\nParagraph 2: Ah, but there is something we don’t know…but should!\n\nExample: Previous work hasn’t examined the effectiveness of party cues when other actors (journalists, rival politicians) allege that the party is motivated by ulterior motives despite this being a common element of political rhetoric\n\nParagraph 3: Preview of your argument\n\nExample: I argue that cues will be less effective in these circumstances because cue taking is built on trustworthiness and these messages undermine trustworthiness.\n\nParagraph 4: Preview of study and findings\n\nExample: I use an experiment where I randomly assign party cues with and without these types of messages; I find that cue taking is indeed undermined.\n\nParagraph 5: Roadmap of paper (potentially)\n\nIn the above, I first try to establish that people should care about party cue taking by highlighting findings that people actually do use them (i.e., they’re a common element of politics) and also that there is something at stake in their use. In this case, the idea is that cue taking may threaten an understanding of democracy wherein elected officials follow the wishes of the public rather than the public simply following its leaders.2 I have thus set up some broader stakes for the paper by tying it to more general normative concerns about democracy. Identifying the stakes of the paper is important; the reader should have some sense of an answer to the ‘so what’ question (i.e., why should we care about this?) before they exit the introduction. In the second paragraph, meanwhile, I tried to highlight a gap in the literature - something we don’t know about. I then gave a preview of my particular argument and what I found. This is something that BAP students sometimes fail to do when writing their thesis to their detriment. As Davis and Musgrave note, the introduction is “not a murder mystery”. You do not want to bury the lede about what you argue and ultimately find! Instead, you should give the reader a roadmap into what is coming further on in the thesis.\n2 Druckman offers a discussion of this tension from the perspective of a public opinion researcher and whether the potential “endogeneity” of public opinion to elite communicates means that the public does not hold “quality opinions”. Disch offers a discussion from the perspective of a normative political theorist and provides an alternative understanding of responsiveness and mass opinion.There are different ways of structuring introductions and, indeed, of motivating the importance of research questions. I strongly recommend reading Three Templates for Introductions to Political Science Articles by Andrew T. Little as this document provides some great ideas of how to effectively structure this section of a paper. In my rendition above, I did this by highlighting something missing from previous research on this topic. In the actual paper, I actually used something like one of the templates identified by Little wherein I suggested that different theoretical traditions in this field predict different outcomes (i.e.: There is something common in politics we don’t know about and, moreover, Theory A predicts X about it while Theory B predicts Y…which one is correct?).\nIn the outline above, I placed a final entry: “Roadmap (potentially)”. This is a reference to ‘roadmap’ paragraphs in which the author outlines the steps they will take in the paper to come (I will first talk about X; then, I will discuss why that is insufficient; then I’ll do this…). I am personally agnostic about the inclusion of such roadmaps in the introduction to a thesis paper. Most of the time the structure is pretty common so its inclusion feels unnecessary. Not everybody feels the same, so it may be sensible to include a short roadmap to cover your bases.",

    "text": "3.1 Outline first\nIn general, it is a good idea to begin with an outline of what you want to write. This will let you start to feel out your argument, and flexibly revise it, without the pressure of having to compose perfect sentences.\nA potential outline might look like this (although, the contents will obviously vary based on what you are writing):\nIn filling in the outline for each paragraph, be sure to keep in mind that each paragraph should be organized around a clear, and singular, point or idea. A goal of the thesis, and indeed all writing, is to clearly communicate ideas. One writing tic that may undermine this goal is over-stuffing paragraphs with too many ideas or points. Instead, focus each paragraph on a main idea with successive paragraphs building on each other to form an overarching argument or point. Steven V. Miller’s tip’s for students page has an example of what I am talking about here that is quite useful.\nThe following is an example of what I mean. It stems from my efforts to puzzle through an idea I had that I was going to write up as a paper for a research workshop. As you can see, such an outline is a start to writing - there are places where I have placeholders (“Final Sentence”), for instance - and its contents are rather barebones. But, it provided me with a start!",

(maybe switch to language of matched morals rather than targeted? easier to talk about mis-matched?).\nImportant for this reason.\nSecond, we focus on competence. speaker credibility is based on two components: beliefs about the intentions/motives of the speaker (sincerity, trustworthiness) and their competence or ability to perform the action in question.\nCompetence is important for this reason.\n\nParagraph 4 or 5: This paper’s argument\n\nWe argue…\nTargeted &gt; non-targeted when it comes to sincerity & matched; targeted = more perceived similarity, so there is a halo effect (?); moral character stuff\nTargeted &lt; non-targeted when it comes to sincerity & mismatched; backlash effect (but is that what the feinberg stuff shows?)\nWhat about competence? More of an open question.\nOn the one hand, if more committed then more likely to work on it.\nOn the other hand, if more commiteed then less likely to compromise and perhaps less likely to have influence!\n\nParagraph 5 or 6: roadmap?\n\nWhat comes next.\n\n\nReview/Theory\n\nParagraph 1: Position Taking is central …\n\nCommon models of democratic politics grounds electoral competition in the programmatic offerings of parties and candidates\nFor instance, promissory theories of representation are based on the idea that parties and candidates make policy promises during election season; voters choose based on those promises; and then parties/candidates are held accountable at the next election based on whether they upheld those promises.\nThis process is iterative however with partisan elites potentially changing their positions over time in response to prior electoral performance and in an effort to anticipate the behavior of future voters (Mansbridge, Erikson, Adams etc.)..\nRegardless of whether this is a backwards or forwards process, policy is central to elections and representation.\n\nParagraph 2: But contested?\n\nParties and candidates spend a good deal of effort cultivating policy positions and publishing party manifestos documenting how they will act in office.\nAnd, yet, the actual role of policy positions on voter choices is contested.\nStudies of proximity voting suggest a role for voter positions, but one that is perhaps limited relative to more long standing concerns such as partisan predispositions or group loyalties. (Warshaw, etc.; maybe footnote Lenz – Of course, this assumes that voters have exogenous preferences to begin with, which is a quite problematic assumption - Kuklinski, Druckman, Lenz, Disch)\nChanges in party positions, on the other hand, do seem to matter but perhaps mostly over time and only to a small extent.\nPolicy is central to how we talk about elections and democratic politics, but it is not always clear whether it should be or not. (too strong?)\n\nParagraph 3: What explains this disconnect?\n\nWhat might explain the lack of more robust evidence about party positioning and voter policy positions?\nThere are a variety of potential answers to this including the (contested) possibility that only some types of issues matter (e.g., strong attitudes, issue importance, moralization; something on moralization) or that party strategies to remain ambiguous may muddy the waters (Somer-Topcu; etc.).\nAnother reason might be that the policy statements of parties and candidates may lack credibility in the eyes of audience members.\nParty position taken occurs in a context wherein many people distrust parties and politicians, believing them to only care about electoral success and willing to pander.\nSuspicion about the motives of partisan elites, perhaps stoked by other actors, may thus undermine the influence of party position taking (Adams, pandering minds, my papers).\nOn the other hand, party positions may be more influential in contexts wherein audience members believe the position to be more credible as when parties take unpopular positions as this is read as going against the party’s interests and hence serves as a costly signal about the party’s true intentions (Vazquez; see also Berinsky; Lupia?).\nFinal sentence\n\n…",

    "text": "3.2 Write and Edit, Edit, Edit…\nHaving an outline in hand first helps clarify what you actually need to write…which is a handy thing to know before you start writing! However, it is, of course, just a first step. You then need to start writing and, important, editing and rewriting as well. Your first draft is almost certainly your worst draft in terms of clarity for the reader. Revisit your writing as much as possible. If possible, have someone read a draft of your thesis and ask them for feedback regarding anything that is unclear or doesn’t make sense.\nHere is some advice for the editing process. Musgrave and Davis provide additional points of value in the following blog posts: Simple Tricks for Better Prose; Show and Tell\n\nProofreading for Clarity\n\nRead the entire paper, checking for any awkward or unclear passages. For any such passage that you find, ask yourself what point you want it to convey. Write the point as if you were explaining it to a friend. Then revise to make it formal.\nBe wary of starting sentences with demonstratives that are not connected to a noun (e.g. “This results in”, “These can affect,” etc.). Sentences such as these invite the question: what is “this” again?\nAvoid using the passive voice if you can help it.\nAvoid beginning paragraphs with “However” or similar clauses. “However” implies a contrast (This thing, however this other thing)…but that would suggest combining the two points into a single paragraph. Either do that or rewrite so that you quickly reintroduce the idea you’re setting yourself up against.\nFinally, make your sentences as short as possible. Doing so will force you to write exactly what you mean. It will also prevent complicated sentence structures from obscuring the meaning of your words. One way to accomplish this task: rewrite sentences with multiple clauses separated by commas and try to eliminate as many commas as possible by rearranging the clauses.\n\nProofreading for Content\n\nPut yourself in the shoes of an intelligent reader who is unfamiliar with the topic. Make sure your argument will be clear to such a person and that you have not left any parts of the argument or evidence unstated or assumed them to be common knowledge.\nOne way to make sure you have done this is to write or revise as if you have a curious (and unusually literate) five-year-old child peering over your shoulder. Your evidence should speak to the series of “but why?” questions that this child will inevitably ask you. The logic and facts you present, what you cite from the sources you use, are the best tools you have to convince that child of your argument.\nDo not assume that you reader(s) know everything about the topic you’re writing about.\n\nProofread for Grammar and Miscellaneous Errors\n\nPolish your writing. Make sure there are no grammatical mistakes, no typos (remember to look for missing words, too), no repetitive words/wordings, and no missing or incorrect citations.",

    "text": "Data Visualization\nYou were introduced to the ggplot package for data visualization in Statistics I/II. This was very much an introduction as the helper materials did not go into everything this series of co[^1]mmands can do. The R Graphics Cookbook provides a much more thorough walkthrough of how to create, and augment, nearly any other type of plot possible with ggplot . Cédric Scherer’s A ggplot2 Tutorial for Beautiful Plotting in R, meanwhile, provides an overview of many of the aesthetic options available in ggplot for creating eye-catching graphics. Finally, Professor Kieran Healy’s book Data Visualization is a great resource for learning about what makes a plot an effective tool for communication in the first place.1\n1 His Bluesky account is a fun read as well.\n\nR Programming\nYou were introduced to the tidyverse in Statistics I/II. One of the most influential resources for working with these tools, and with R in general, can be found in the book R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. Wickham is one of the progenitors of this library of R packages and on the shortlist for most influential people in the broader R universe. This book is for those who want to push their knowledge of R further and perhaps particularly for those that might be thinking of going into data science or something similar in their post-graduate life.\n\n\nR Markdown\nYou may very well write your thesis using two programs: a word processor (e.g., Microsoft Word or [shudder] Google Docs) for the actual writing and R-Studio for the analyses. However, you could very well write the whole thing in R-Studio as an R Markdown document. The book R Markdown Cookbook by Yihui Zie, Christophe Dervieux, and Emily Riederer is resource is for those bold few who are thinking of doing that as it delves into the wide array of options available to you in doing so.\nOne note here: if you’re writing your thesis in R Markdown, then I recommend that you also install and use Zotero as a citation manager. I recommend using a citation manager in general, but Zotero can be used with R-Markdown documents, making the inclusion of in-text citations and the (automatic) generation of a bibliography section much easier. See this blog entry on how to add citations in R Markdown using Zotero.",
